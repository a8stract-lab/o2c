Linux kernel
============

on-the-fly compartmentalization with eBPF, in samples/ebpf

- comp_*_sample, dump the objects from running kernel
- comp_*_working, compartmentalize the untrusted driver
- comp_*_working1, compartmentalizes part of untrusted driver, rather than the entire driver.


There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
